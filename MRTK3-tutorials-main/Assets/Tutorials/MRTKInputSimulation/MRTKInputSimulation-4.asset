      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Objects can be grabbed with hands at either a far or near
          distance. \n\nWhen grabbing an object at a far distance, a hand ray is
          visible with a reticle (circular icon) that attaches to the object. Once
          the reticle makes contact with the object, hold the <b>Left Mouse Button</b>
          to grab the object.\n\nWhen grabbing an object at a near distance, the
          reticle on the tip of the pointer finger must be in direct contact with
          the object. You can use the mouse scroll wheel to change the depth of the
          hand. Once the pointer finger makes contact with the object, press the
          <b>Left Mouse Button</b> to grab the object. \n\nLet's try grabbing the
          <b>Treasure Chest</b>.\n"

        m_Untranslated: "<b>To execute a far grab interaction, we can toggle the
          hand and interact with the object from our starting position.</b>\n\n<b>1.</b>
          Press <b>Play</b> to enter Play Mode.\n\n<b>2.</b> Hold the <b>Space</b>
          key and move the mouse so that the right hand's hand ray comes in contact
          with the <b>Treasure Chest</b>. When the hand has made contact with the
          <b>Treasure Chest</b>, the reticle can be seen on top of the object.\n\n<b>3.</b>
          Press the <b>Left Mouse Button</b> to grab the <b>Treasure Chest</b>. Once
          grabbed, you should be able to lift the chest from the sand and move it
          to another position in the aquarium tank.\n\n<b>4.</b> To release the <b>Treasure
          Chest</b>, let go of the <b>Left Mouse Button</b>.\n\n<b>5.</b> Try the
          same interaction with the left hand. As a reminder, you can execute latched
          tracking for the left hand by pressing the <b>T</b> key and using the <b>Left
          Shift</b> key and mouse to move the hand around the scene.\n\n<b>6.</b>
          Feel free to grab and scale the other objects in the aquarium tank. A bounding
          box with handles surrounds the objects as well to provide fine-tune manipulation
          such as rotation and scaling. To rotate or scale, grab a handle and drag
          with your mouse.\n\n<b>Note</b>: Only the <b>Treasure Chest</b> and <b>Boat</b>
          objects cannot be scaled.\n\n<b>To execute a near grab interaction, we
          can either move the camera closer to the object <i>or</i> change the depth
          of the hand. Let's change the depth of the hand to interact with the object.</b>
          \n\n<b>1.</b>Press the <b>Y</b> key to toggle the right hand.\n\n<b>2.</b>
          Hold the <b>Space</b> key and move the mouse so that the right hand's hand
          ray comes in contact with the <b>Treasure Chest</b>. When the hand has
          made contact with the <b>Treasure Chest</b>, the reticle can be seen on
          top of the object.\n\n<b>3.</b> Using the mouse scroll wheel, scroll forward
          and continue to position the hand with the mouse so that the reticle displays
          on top of the object. As the hand gets closer to the <b>Treasure Chest</b>,
          the ray will shorten until the ray is no longer visible \u2013 only the
          reticle will remain visible. \n\n<b>4.</b> Press the <b>Left Mouse Button</b>
          to grab the <b>Treasure Chest</b>. Once grabbed, you should be able to
          lift the chest from the sand and move it to another position in the aquarium
          tank.\n\n<b>5.</b> To release the <b>Treasure Chest</b>, let go of the
          <b>Left Mouse Button</b>.\n\n<b>6.</b> Try the same interaction with the
          left hand. As a reminder, you can execute latched tracking for the left
          hand by pressing the <b>T</b> key and using the <b>Left Shift</b> key and
          mouse to move the hand around the scene.\n\n<b>7.</b> Feel free to grab
          and scale the other objects in the aquarium tank. A bounding box with handles
          surrounds the objects as well to provide fine-tune manipulation such as
          rotation and scaling. To rotate or scale, grab a handle and drag with your
          mouse.\n\n<b>Note</b>: Only the <b>Treasure Chest</b> and <b>Boat</b> objects
