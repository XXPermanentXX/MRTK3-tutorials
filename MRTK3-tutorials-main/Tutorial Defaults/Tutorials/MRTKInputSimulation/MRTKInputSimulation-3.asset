        m_Untranslated: How to Press a Button
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Buttons can be pressed by hand at either a far or near distance.
          \n\nWhen executing a far interaction button press, a hand ray is visible
          with a reticle (circular icon) that attaches to the button. Once the reticle
          makes contact with the button, a mouse click executes a button press.\n\nWhen
          executing a near interaction button press, the reticle on the tip of the
          pointer finger must be in direct contact with the button. There is a nonvisible
          press layer configured with the button that the finger must collide with
          and push to be considered a press. You can use the mouse scroll wheel to
          change the depth of the hand.\n\nLet's try pressing the <b>Hide</b> button
          to toggle the visibility of the <b>Treasure Chest</b>.\n"

          the hand and interact with the button from our starting position.</b>\n\n<b>1.</b>
          Press <b>Play</b> to enter Play Mode.\n\n<b>2.</b> Press the <b>Y</b> key
          to toggle the right hand. Notice that a hand ray protrudes from the hand.
          If you don't see the hand ray, try scrolling the scroll wheel on your mouse
          to make the hand closer to you (in other words, closer to the camera).\n\n<b>3.</b>
          Hold the <b>Space</b> key and move the mouse so that the right hand's hand
          ray comes in contact with the <b>Hide</b> button, which is located to the
          right of the Treasure Chest. When the hand has made contact with the <b>Hide</b>
          button, the reticle can be seen on top of the button.\n\n<b>4.</b> Press
          your left mouse button to press the <b>Hide</b> button. Notice that the
          toggle switch moves from left to right and the <b>Treasure Chest</b> is
          no longer visible.\n\n<b>5.</b> Press the <b>Hide</b> button once more
          to toggle the visibility of the <b>Treasure Chest</b>. The <b>Treasure
          Chest</b> should now be visible.\n\n<b>6.</b> Try the same interaction
          with the left hand. As a reminder, you can execute latched tracking for
          the left hand by pressing the <b>T</b> key and using the <b>Left Shift</b>
          key and mouse to move the hand around the scene.\n\n<b>To execute a near
          interaction button press, we can either move the camera closer to the button
          <i>or</i> change the depth of the hand. Let's change the depth of the hand
          to interact with the button.</b> \n\n<b>1.</b>Press the <b>Y</b> key to
          toggle the right hand.\n\n<b>2.</b> Hold the <b>Space</b> key and move
          the mouse so that the right hand's hand ray comes in contact with the <b>Hide</b>
          button. When the hand has made contact with the <b>Hide</b> button, the
          reticle can be seen on top of the button.\n\n\n<b>3.</b> Using the mouse
          scroll wheel, scroll forward and continue to position the hand with the
          mouse so that the reticle displays on top of the button. Continue to scroll
          the mouse wheel forward until the button is moved back on the Z axis \u2013
          this indicates a button press. If pressed successfully, the <b>Treasure
          Chest</b> should no longer be visible.\n\n<b>4.</b> Press the <b>Hide</b>
          button once more to toggle the visibility of the <b>Treasure Chest</b>.
          The <b>Treasure Chest</b> should now be visible.\n\n<b>5.</b> Try the same
          interaction with the left hand. As a reminder, you can execute latched
          tracking for the left hand by pressing the <b>T</b> key and using the left
          Shift key and mouse to move the hand around the scene.\n\n<b>6.</b> Once
