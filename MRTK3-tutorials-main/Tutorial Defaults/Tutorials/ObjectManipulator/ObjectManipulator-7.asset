        m_Untranslated: Allowed Interaction Types
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "The methods for interacting with an object are relatively
          flexible. By default, the <b>Allowed Interaction Types</b> property enables
          all types of configured interactions. However, you can limit the type of
          interaction to either a <b>Near</b>, <b>Ray</b>, <b>Gaze</b>, or <b>Generic</b>
          interaction.\n\n<b>Near</b> interactions are interactions which occur within
          a close distance to an object, such as direct manipulation with hands.
          \n\n<b>Ray</b> interactions are typically used for far distances. When
          a ray interaction occurs, a ray extends from a hand or controller. This
          allows you to  interact with any object the ray's recticule (circular icon)
          touches.\n\n<b>Gaze</b> interactions rely on the position of either your
          head or eyes. This interaction is often coupled with a commit action such
          as a voice command or gesture--for example, you can look at an object and
          say \u2018Select\u2019.\n\n<b>Generic</b> interactions refer to any type
          of interaction not previously specified or coded to accommodate.\n\nBe
          mindful that not all XR devices support each interaction type. For example,
          eye-tracking is a requirement for eye gaze, so if your device doesn't 
          support eye-tracking, you wouldn\u2019t be able to leverage eye gaze for
          interactions. Consider the limitations of the device before you choose
          to limit interaction types.\n\nLet\u2019s apply what you\u2019ve learned
          about <b>Allowed Interaction Types</b> and limit the interaction to only
          allow a <b>Near</b> interaction with the <b>Treasure Chest</b>. This configuration
          would be appropriate for an app or experience where you want the user to
          interact only with objects that are within hands-reach, not across the
          room."
